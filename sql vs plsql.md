### PL/SQL(procedural language SQL) vs SQL
* procedural -> allows us to execute any part of code at any point of time.
* PL/SQL block of code consists of
  * Procedures
  * Functions
  * Loops
  * Variables
  * Triggers
* Application:
  * Web apps, server pages
  * disadvantage -> cant use OOPS like encapsulation,hiding,abstraction,etc....
### SQL
  * exclusive for RDBMS-> CRUD
  * they use key to inter related to different tables
  * mysql,oracle,sqlserver,sybase

  * **Active Server Pages** (ASP) enables web servers to dynamically generate webpages and create interactive web applications by using server-side scripting technology.
